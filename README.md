# Women-Safety-App

* A simple mobile app I worked on with my team during a 1-day hackathon. 
* The app has a simple home page, sign-up/login page and provides emergency contact numbers specifically for women safety. 
* There is an emergency SOS buttons that reads the user's current location and writes it into a text file. (the intent was to send the data to an organization given an official contact endpoint or an API to facilitate the same)
